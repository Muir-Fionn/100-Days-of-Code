# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 01 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built Layout for Tic-Tac-Toe board in HTML/CSS using Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** While building the board in Bootstrap helped me to familiarize myself with it, I'm worried that it might cause issues for me later.  We'll see as I start working on the js code tomorrow to allow for actual game play.

**Today's Progress:** Finished boxSelect and newBoard functions.

**Thoughts:** Extra research and a couple of tutorial practices on Free Code Camp helped me figure out the onclick targeting issues for boxSelect.  Got further practice with newGame function.  Going to add the board test logic tomorrow and complete this project.

**Today's Progress:** Finished Tic-Tac-Toe game.

**Thoughts:** The logic for testing if a user has won seems really long and clunky.  Might review later to see if I can refactor at all.

### Day 5: 05 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Designed HTML and CSS for random quote generator.

**Thoughts:** Need to work with twitter font awesome icon in order to align it within a button element properly.  Still not fully comfortable with CSS or design layout.

### Day 6: 06 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Edited HTML/CSS for personal profile. Added contact form.

**Thoughts:** Design is still a struggle for me.  Trying to figure out what will look good/professional is complicated for me.

### Day 7: 07 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Complete rework of my personal portfolio.  Worked on general layout and responsiveness today.

**Thoughts:** I found it was easier for me to work in the Atom text editor than in Codepen. Used a different layout scheme that turned out much easier to encode for responsiveness. Feel confident about the layout.  Now to edit colors and add proper links/photos.

### Day 8: 08 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Completed two basic kata (algorithm challenges) on CodeWars in C: Playing with Digits and Consecutive Strings

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed stepping away from HTML and CSS and practicing my first language again.  Consecutive Strings was frusting, but taught me a lot about working with strings in C (something that I normally avoid by using C++ instead).  Playing with Digits was very straight forward and a nice starting algorithm for me, reminding me of all the nuances to working in C.  I even liked it enough to take the time to write a more functional program that could take in test cases to verify the solution, or use the solution to test out randome numbers.

### Day 9: 09 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on API integration for Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure if it's codepen, the website I'm trying to use, or just me, but I am really struggling to figure out the AJAX request for the quote API that I need to use.  I'll do some more research tomorrow and try again.

### Day 10: 10 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Finished off Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** So it was a combination of my AJAX call, and using the https version of codepen.  Did some research and found the right set up to use to get it working.  After that, it was easy to add in functionality to the twitter button.  So there is one project down and on to the weather app.

### Day 11: 11 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Completed CodeWars kata and wrote basic pixel paint program in HTML/JS

**Thoughts:** The pixel painter was a simple program after the random quote generator, but kept me working with JavaScript without too much focus on the HTML/CSS side.

### Day 12: 12 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Ordinary Ordinals and Title Case challenges for CS50x Hackathon on Hackerrank

**Thoughts:** A bit interesting to jump into not having a lot of experience parsing strings in C or using the custom CS50x library.

### Day 13: 13 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Data Types and Operators challenges for Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code

**Thoughts:** Good exercieses to build back up my familiarity with C

### Day 14: 14 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Wrote basic javascript algorithms using conditional statements, while and for loops; including FizzBuzz.

**Thoughts:** Most of the algorithms were familiar to me from C.  It was good practice to convert to javascript.

### Day 15: 15 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Conditional Statements and Class vs Instance challenges for Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code

**Thoughts:** Straightforward exercises, built and tested one function at a time.

### Day 16: 16 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built weather app using the APIXU API and minimal HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts:** Interesting, but reassuring, to find out that Chrome web browsers do not allow HTML5 location calls from non-secure addresses. Proces: Built HTML and CSS framework for weather app.  Researched and set up geolocation call.  Retrieved weather API key and reviewed expected JSON API return. Built AJAX call and DOM update function.

### Day 17: 17 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Completed two challenges on HackerRank

**Thoughts:** Woking in C and Bash practicing loops and conditional statements.  Also completed a couple of JavaScript lessons in The Web Developer Bootcamp.

### Day 18: 18 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Added text for About Me and Example Summary on my personal portfolio.  Also completed a simple JavaScript Function Exercise for The Web Developer Bootcamp and a C algorithm for HackerRank.

**Thoughts:** This is one of the last actual non-design related aspects that needed to be done with my personal portfolio.  It was good to get this writing out of the way so that now I can focus on the UX/UI side of the CodePen.

### Day 18.5: 19 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Did lessons on Udemy and SoloLearn, but work and family commitments overlapped so that I didn't actually make it to adding in an hour of focused coding.

### Day 19: 20 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built a basic array To Do list to function in the javascript console. Also practiced with forEach method and looping over arrays.

**Thoughts:** Very basic system.  Main point was to generate experience with javascript arrays and work out the basic logic. May expand this into an app after I have a better grasp on DOM manipulation.

### Day 20: 21 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built a personal movie database to practice with nested arrays and objects. Also attempted some work on the HackerRank phonebook challenge in C, but had difficulty passing and accessing my struct in functions. 

**Thoughts:** Not being able to figure out the phone book challenge in HackerRank was frustrating. Going to try using two arrays instead of a struct tomorrow and see if I have better luck there.

### Day 21: 22 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built Color Toggle and Score Keeper apps in javascript to practice DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts:** DOM manipulation is a little tricky, but I'm looking forward to the things that it will enable as I get more familiar with it.

### Day 22: 23 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Solved 3 Challenges for HackerRank 30 Days of Code in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Easier to deal with strings and dictionaries in JavaScript than C.  Took a break from C to catch up on 30 Days of Code and work out the code.  Plan to do more practice in C and go back to try these again.

### Day 23: 24 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Built HTML/CSS framework on Wikipedia Viewer for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Played with Navbar and Jumbotron in Bootstrap.

### Day 24: 25 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Wrote JavaScript logic to finish Wikipedia viewer.

**Thoughts:** Got rid of the unneeded navbar.  Added in event listeners for focusout or enter keypress to text input and click listener to Go button.  Now that I know what errors to prepare for, AJAX calls are becoming much easier. Most interesting part was finding Object.entries() to convert "pages" object to an array allowing me to use forEach().
