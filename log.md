### Day 38: 08 February 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Completed Advanced Algorithm Scripting on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Make A Person and Map the Debris were easy and straightforward.  Pairwise is another algorithm that is getting added to the rework to refactor list.

**Link to work:** [Make A Person (FCC)](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/make-a-person) | [Code](https://github.com/Muir-Fionn/FreeCodeCamp/blob/master/Advanced%20Algorithm%20Scripting/makeAPerson.js) || [Map the Debris (FCC)](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/map-the-debris) | [Code](https://github.com/Muir-Fionn/FreeCodeCamp/blob/master/Advanced%20Algorithm%20Scripting/mapTheDebris.js) || [Pairwise (FCC)](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/pairwise) | [Code](https://github.com/Muir-Fionn/FreeCodeCamp/blob/master/Advanced%20Algorithm%20Scripting/pairwise.js)

### Day 37: 07 February 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Completed Friendly Date Ranges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** This one was easier than No Repeats Please by far. I feel like my set up of all the conditionals to see if the date is within 1 year.  This is one of the algorithms that I'm going to mark for refactor next month.

### Day 36: 06 February 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Finished No Repeats Please.

**Thoughts:** I had to reference FreeCodeCamp's relative GitHub to figure this out.  I'd managed to get to the essence of Heap's Algorithm, but I was implementing my filter incorrectly and made mistakes with my variable scopes.

**Link to work:** [No Repeats Please](https://github.com/Muir-Fionn/FreeCodeCamp/blob/master/Advanced%20Algorithm%20Scripting/noRepeatsPlease.js)


### Day 35: 05 February 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Hit a wall on No Repeats Please for Free Code Camp.  Taking a break to do some more research on permutations.

**Thoughts:** While I can identify my base cases, trying to find all possible permutations is a bit overwhelming. I've written out the high level logic and conditional tests for each base case for now.

### Day 34: 04 February 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built a simple Patatap Clone.

**Thoughts:** Project for ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy.  Practice using external libraries (Paper JS and Howler JS). Due to CORS issues, sounds to not work on the CodePen version.

**Today's Progress:** Built a simple in browser To Do App using HTML/CSS and jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Project for ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy.  Good practice using the this keyword in javascript when attaching event listeners.  Also learned how to apply event listeners using the on method so that the listener is add to future elements of the page as well without having to build a call a function everytime a list item is added.

### Day 29: 30 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Completed a practice code interview problem on Interview Cake called "Apple Stocks" in Python

**Thoughts:** Python's syntactic differences from JavaScript and C is my biggest struggle with the language.  This was most obvious on loops and conditional statements.  What can I say?  I like parentheses and braces.

**Link to work:** [Apple Stocks](https://gist.github.com/Muir-Fionn/27395cadc9cc30d70352d40ffa3c0527)

### Day 28: 29 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Twitch JSON API app for FreeCodeCamp.  Completed JavaScript DOM logic and cleaned up UI.

**Thoughts:** Mostly playing around with different DOM manipulation methods and algorithms to meet all the user stories. Biggest win of the day was realizing that I only needed to do one API call if the user was streaming allowing me to build the online/offline functions rather than logo/status functions.

### Day 27: 28 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Started on the Twitch JSON API app for FreeCodeCamp.  Built HTML/CSS base.  Started on JavaScript logic.

**Thoughts:** AJAX calls are becoming simpler.  Now it's just playing around with what's returned to ensure that I meet the user stories in the most effective way.

**Link to work:** [Twitch JSON API](https://codepen.io/muir-fionn/full/YNEXva/)

### Day 26: 27 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Started learning python. Built functions to satisfy Problem Set 1 for MIT 6.00.1x on edX.

**Thoughts:** Basic logic to analyze strings using Python.  Syntax is significantly different than what I'm used to, but I'll take that tradeoff for the ease of string analysis.

**Link to work:** [Problem Set 1](https://gist.github.com/Muir-Fionn/921bb462e3c2ca1496190d63be7c0a8e)

### Day 25: 26 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built in browsesr RGB Color Guessing Game.

**Thoughts:** Logic was straightforward.  Great practice figuring out when/how to use the this keyword and breaking down code into functions.

### Day 24: 25 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Wrote JavaScript logic to finish Wikipedia viewer.

**Thoughts:** Got rid of the unneeded navbar.  Added in event listeners for focusout or enter keypress to text input and click listener to Go button.  Now that I know what errors to prepare for, AJAX calls are becoming much easier. Most interesting part was finding Object.entries() to convert "pages" object to an array allowing me to use forEach().

### Day 22: 23 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Solved 3 Challenges for HackerRank 30 Days of Code in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Easier to deal with strings and dictionaries in JavaScript than C.  Took a break from C to catch up on 30 Days of Code and work out the code.  Plan to do more practice in C and go back to try these again.

### Day 20: 21 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built a personal movie database to practice with nested arrays and objects. Also attempted some work on the HackerRank phonebook challenge in C, but had difficulty passing and accessing my struct in functions. 

**Thoughts:** Not being able to figure out the phone book challenge in HackerRank was frustrating. Going to try using two arrays instead of a struct tomorrow and see if I have better luck there.

### Day 19: 20 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built a basic array To Do list to function in the javascript console. Also practiced with forEach method and looping over arrays.

**Thoughts:** Very basic system.  Main point was to generate experience with javascript arrays and work out the basic logic. May expand this into an app after I have a better grasp on DOM manipulation.

### Day 18.5: 19 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Did lessons on Udemy and SoloLearn, but work and family commitments overlapped so that I didn't actually make it to adding in an hour of focused coding.

### Day 18: 18 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Added text for About Me and Example Summary on my personal portfolio.  Also completed a simple JavaScript Function Exercise for The Web Developer Bootcamp and a C algorithm for HackerRank.

**Thoughts:** This is one of the last actual non-design related aspects that needed to be done with my personal portfolio.  It was good to get this writing out of the way so that now I can focus on the UX/UI side of the CodePen.

### Day 16: 16 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Built weather app using the APIXU API and minimal HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts:** Interesting, but reassuring, to find out that Chrome web browsers do not allow HTML5 location calls from non-secure addresses. Proces: Built HTML and CSS framework for weather app.  Researched and set up geolocation call.  Retrieved weather API key and reviewed expected JSON API return. Built AJAX call and DOM update function.

### Day 11: 11 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Completed CodeWars kata and wrote basic pixel paint program in HTML/JS

**Thoughts:** The pixel painter was a simple program after the random quote generator, but kept me working with JavaScript without too much focus on the HTML/CSS side.

### Day 10: 10 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Finished off Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** So it was a combination of my AJAX call, and using the https version of codepen.  Did some research and found the right set up to use to get it working.  After that, it was easy to add in functionality to the twitter button.  So there is one project down and on to the weather app.

### Day 9: 09 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Worked on API integration for Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure if it's codepen, the website I'm trying to use, or just me, but I am really struggling to figure out the AJAX request for the quote API that I need to use.  I'll do some more research tomorrow and try again.

### Day 8: 08 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Completed two basic kata (algorithm challenges) on CodeWars in C: Playing with Digits and Consecutive Strings

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed stepping away from HTML and CSS and practicing my first language again.  Consecutive Strings was frusting, but taught me a lot about working with strings in C (something that I normally avoid by using C++ instead).  Playing with Digits was very straight forward and a nice starting algorithm for me, reminding me of all the nuances to working in C.  I even liked it enough to take the time to write a more functional program that could take in test cases to verify the solution, or use the solution to test out randome numbers.

### Day 7: 07 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Complete rework of my personal portfolio.  Worked on general layout and responsiveness today.

**Thoughts:** I found it was easier for me to work in the Atom text editor than in Codepen. Used a different layout scheme that turned out much easier to encode for responsiveness. Feel confident about the layout.  Now to edit colors and add proper links/photos.

**Today's Progress:** Designed HTML and CSS for random quote generator.

**Thoughts:** Need to work with twitter font awesome icon in order to align it within a button element properly.  Still not fully comfortable with CSS or design layout.

**Today's Progress:** Finished Tic-Tac-Toe game.

**Thoughts:** The logic for testing if a user has won seems really long and clunky.  Might review later to see if I can refactor at all.

**Today's Progress:** Finished boxSelect and newBoard functions.

**Thoughts:** Extra research and a couple of tutorial practices on Free Code Camp helped me figure out the onclick targeting issues for boxSelect.  Got further practice with newGame function.  Going to add the board test logic tomorrow and complete this project.

**Today's Progress:** Built Layout for Tic-Tac-Toe board in HTML/CSS using Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** While building the board in Bootstrap helped me to familiarize myself with it, I'm worried that it might cause issues for me later.  We'll see as I start working on the js code tomorrow to allow for actual game play.
