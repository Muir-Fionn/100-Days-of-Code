**Today's Progress:** Built Layout for Tic-Tac-Toe board in HTML/CSS using Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** While building the board in Bootstrap helped me to familiarize myself with it, I'm worried that it might cause issues for me later.  We'll see as I start working on the js code tomorrow to allow for actual game play.

**Today's Progress:** Finished boxSelect and newBoard functions.

**Thoughts:** Extra research and a couple of tutorial practices on Free Code Camp helped me figure out the onclick targeting issues for boxSelect.  Got further practice with newGame function.  Going to add the board test logic tomorrow and complete this project.

**Today's Progress:** Finished Tic-Tac-Toe game.

**Thoughts:** The logic for testing if a user has won seems really long and clunky.  Might review later to see if I can refactor at all.

**Today's Progress:** Designed HTML and CSS for random quote generator.

**Thoughts:** Need to work with twitter font awesome icon in order to align it within a button element properly.  Still not fully comfortable with CSS or design layout.

**Today's Progress:** Edited HTML/CSS for personal profile. Added contact form.

**Thoughts:** Design is still a struggle for me.  Trying to figure out what will look good/professional is complicated for me.

### Day 7: 07 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Complete rework of my personal portfolio.  Worked on general layout and responsiveness today.

**Thoughts:** I found it was easier for me to work in the Atom text editor than in Codepen. Used a different layout scheme that turned out much easier to encode for responsiveness. Feel confident about the layout.  Now to edit colors and add proper links/photos.

### Day 8: 08 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed two basic kata (algorithm challenges) on CodeWars in C: Playing with Digits and Consecutive Strings

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed stepping away from HTML and CSS and practicing my first language again.  Consecutive Strings was frusting, but taught me a lot about working with strings in C (something that I normally avoid by using C++ instead).  Playing with Digits was very straight forward and a nice starting algorithm for me, reminding me of all the nuances to working in C.  I even liked it enough to take the time to write a more functional program that could take in test cases to verify the solution, or use the solution to test out randome numbers.

### Day 9: 09 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on API integration for Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure if it's codepen, the website I'm trying to use, or just me, but I am really struggling to figure out the AJAX request for the quote API that I need to use.  I'll do some more research tomorrow and try again.

### Day 10: 10 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished off Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** So it was a combination of my AJAX call, and using the https version of codepen.  Did some research and found the right set up to use to get it working.  After that, it was easy to add in functionality to the twitter button.  So there is one project down and on to the weather app.

### Day 11: 11 January 2017

[] (##### (delete me or comment me out))

**Today's Progress:** Completed CodeWars kata and wrote basic pixel paint program in HTML/JS

**Thoughts:** The pixel painter was a simple program after the random quote generator, but kept me working with JavaScript without too much focus on the HTML/CSS side.

### Day 12: 12 January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Ordinary Ordinals and Title Case challenges for CS50x Hackathon on Hackerrank

**Thoughts:** A bit interesting to jump into not having a lot of experience parsing strings in C or using the custom CS50x library.
