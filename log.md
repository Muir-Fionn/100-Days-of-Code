**Today's Progress:** Built Layout for Tic-Tac-Toe board in HTML/CSS using Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** While building the board in Bootstrap helped me to familiarize myself with it, I'm worried that it might cause issues for me later.  We'll see as I start working on the js code tomorrow to allow for actual game play.
