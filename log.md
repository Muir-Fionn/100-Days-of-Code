**Today's Progress:** Built Layout for Tic-Tac-Toe board in HTML/CSS using Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** While building the board in Bootstrap helped me to familiarize myself with it, I'm worried that it might cause issues for me later.  We'll see as I start working on the js code tomorrow to allow for actual game play.

**Today's Progress:** Started on javascript logic.

**Today's Progress:** Finished boxSelect and newBoard functions.

**Thoughts:** Extra research and a couple of tutorial practices on Free Code Camp helped me figure out the onclick targeting issues for boxSelect.  Got further practice with newGame function.  Going to add the board test logic tomorrow and complete this project.
